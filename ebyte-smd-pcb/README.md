# EBYTE SMD PCB

EBYTE's SPI module is a 1.27mm pitch SMD module.   
So I designed a conversion board that converts from 1.27mm pitch to 2.54mm pitch.   
You can order the PCB yourself using the publicly available Gerber files.

# How to order PCB
You can order by yourself on PCBWay using ```EBYTE-E22-SMD.zip```.   
This is my order (to PCBWay) information.   
I ordered it on February 17th and it arrived to me on February 24th.

# Why PCBWay?
I have used several PCB manufacturers in the past, but lately I have only used PCBWay.

 PCBWay's PCBs meet the highest standards of quality and reliability, they are also capable of meeting the technical demands of any project, from simple projects like mine to very complicated projects.

- Customization and Flexibility   
 They offer extensive customization options, allowing board designers to tailor their PCBs precisely to their project's needs.

- Support for orders   
 English is not my native language. I was worried when I first ordered, but PCBWay supported me.
