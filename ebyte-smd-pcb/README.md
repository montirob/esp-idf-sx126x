# EBYTE SMD PCB

EBYTE's SPI module is a 1.27mm pitch SMD module.   
So I designed a conversion board that converts from 1.27mm pitch to 2.54mm pitch.   
You can order the PCB yourself using the publicly available Gerber files.

# How to order PCB
You can order by yourself on PCBWay using ```EBYTE-E22-SMD.zip```.   
This is my order (to PCBWay) information.   
I ordered it on February 17th and it arrived to me on February 24th.   
You can repeat my order from [here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/EBYTE_SPI_LoRa_module_pitch_converter_6c8c2ec2.html).

# Why PCBWay?
I have used several PCB manufacturers in the past, but lately I have only used PCBWay.   

- Quality and Reliability   
 PCBWay's PCBs meet the highest standards of quality and reliability, they are also capable of meeting the technical demands of any project, from simple projects like mine to very complicated projects.

- Customization and Flexibility   
 They offer extensive customization options, allowing board designers to tailor their PCBs precisely to their project's needs.

- Support for orders   
 Many PCB manufacturers have pages for ordering, but PCBWay's ordering page is the easiest to use.   
 The easiest way to order is to select your PCB size and resist color.   
 PCBWay will provide you with a price after verifying the validity of your board manufacturing information.   
 This is very important to me as English is not my native language.   

- Shipping options   
 I always use the cheaper option and am very happy with the delivery quality and delivery time.
